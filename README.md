# Nextflix
Launch Academy - Final Project

#Brief Description

Nextflix is for those who find themselves sitting next to a friend, family, or significant other,
and want to watch something together. But in your personal experience, the conversation always seems
to go something like:

You: "Hey, is there anything you've been wanting to watch lately?"
Them: "I'm okay with watching whatever you want."

And then this is your face --> -_-

You've now lost 30min and cycling through shows and movies deciding if there is anything the two of you will mutually like, 
which has now taken movies out of the options due to your time constraints of bedtime... And don't even get me started on...

Anyways, Nextflix is an app that saves you the trouble of that akward 30-60min of decesion making that could have
been spent actually enjoying a cinematic masterpiece.

With Nextflix users can coast through thousands of shows and movies which they can favorite as, "want to watch." When 
the user is ready with their options, they can then compare with a mutual connection/user and voila! Nextflix, will
tell you that both matched as intersted in watching these specific shows/movies that you both, "want to watch."

So save yourself some time and frustration by downloading this app.
